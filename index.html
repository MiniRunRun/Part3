            <span>Scattered blue and white porcelain bowls and slightly yellowed chopsticks</span>
            <span>lay carelessly abandoned on the wooden kitchen table.</span>
            <span>Along with a low, murmuring hum of water coursing through the radiator.</span>
            <span>Outside, the faint patter of rain intermittently taps against the hush of the night.</span>
            <span>I lie on the pitch-black sofa in the living room, feeling the world slowly</span>
            <span>sink into the embrace of the endless sounds of rain dropping.</span>
            <span>When the wind rises, raindrops beat against the window panes, grass bends</span>
            <span>in tangled disarray, and tree branches sway wantonly in the darkness.</span>
            <span>Their withered limbs are reaching to evade this home, nestled above the ground.</span>

                <p style="background-color: none;">At the end of the narrow hallway, the doors on both sides remain tightly shut; my brother and father must have already drifted into sleep. The darkness inside feels heavy, as though it might collapse  into the wooden ground. The suitcase sprawled open on the floor in two halves, swallows and mirrors out  all sense of emptiness. Clothes from all seasons dispersed across the bed, silently waiting to be searched and packed. Restlessness bubbles within me. I rise abruptly, ready to complete the final step before departure. As I lift my gaze, delicate specks of dust descend slowly from the ceiling, caught in the faint glow of the overhead light.  </details>

                <span> of imperfect, perfect pictures. As social media </span>
                <span>continues to paint images of perfect photos </span>
                 <span>of people with perfect lives, families, and careers, </span>
                 <span>film photos challenge this preconceived notion </span>
